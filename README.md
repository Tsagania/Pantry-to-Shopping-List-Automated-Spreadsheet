# Pantry-to-Shopping-List-Automated-Spreadsheet
In order to help with the kitchen/pantry organization I came up with this speadsheet.

My goals: 
  1. prevent forgeting to buy products that I run out and lost sight of 
  2. to keep a note when I am out of a product during the week, so I do not have to spend time before shopping
  3. output a shopping list with products I run out of
  

1st sheet:

    -Contains everything I ever bought from a supermarket, when I buy new products they are added there (goal 1. )
    -Set different availability categories for each product (Plenty, Low, None) which reflects the availability in the pantry (goal 2.)
 
2nd sheet:

    -The sheet is locked because it is the "calculation" phase, which creates the output (the shopping list)
    -The table on the sheet contains all products from the category "None", which were set on the first sheet
    -Columns L,M,N trasform the table into list and strip blank and N/A cells
  
3rd sheet:

    -There is data only in column A which is our shopping list (goal 3.)
